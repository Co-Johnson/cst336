            <h3>Magic Leap</h3>
            <p>
                Magic Leap is currently the most hyped Augmented Reality headset. Its creator edition, Magic 
                Leap One, was just released August 8th 2018. While the Magic Leap One may not have lived up
                to the hype, only comming in as slightly more advanced then Microsofts HoloLens, it should give
                creators the tools necessary to jump into creating the Augmented Reality experiences we're all
                looking for. Magic one is currently building production facilities for a several different 
                headsets.
