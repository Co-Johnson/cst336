            <h3>Google Glass</h3>
            <p>
                While Google Glass may not have survived as a consumer product, the industrial 
                use of Augmented Reality is taking off. Boeing has partnered with Upskill using 
                Glass to solve the problem of wiring new aircraft. Glass allows technicians to 
                view wiring diagrams or watch videos of correct installations. It can also allow 
                users to live-stream their view to more experienced workers when they run into 
                trouble. This has decreased the time it takes to wire an aircraft by 25% and 
                reduced errors below 1%. This is one small sample showing the potential Augmented 
                Reality has to change how we work.
