            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <blockquote>“Simply put, we believe augmented reality is going to change the way we use 
            technology forever. We’re already seeing things that will transform the way you work, 
            play, connect and learn.” — Tim Cook</blockquote>

                Augmented reality gives us the ability to overlay virtual data on top of the real world.
                Previously, augmented reality was limited to military technologies like heads up displays
                and television broadcasts such as sports overlays; now with advances in smartphone 
                technologies, augmented reality is working its way into our everyday lives. While mobile
                augmented reality is in the spotlight from Pokémon Go and Snapchat filters, industrial 
                applications are changing the way we work and interface with technology.

                While the immediate future for consumer Augmented Reality will come from smartphones, 
                the following pages will take a look at some of the current and upcoming Augmented Reality 
                headsets.
